      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
            Hello! I’m Yousef Shalaby, a passionate and dedicated undergraduate student currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity. With a strong interest in safeguarding digital assets and protecting information from evolving cyber threats, I’ve honed my skills in areas such as network security, ethical hacking, risk management, and cryptography.

        Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience through various projects, labs, and internships, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios. I am constantly exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity and am excited to take on challenges that allow me to grow and contribute to a safer digital world.
        
        I’m particularly passionate about ethical hacking and penetration testing, and I aspire to help organizations strengthen their defenses against cyber threats. With a keen eye for detail, problem-solving, and a commitment to learning, I am eager to make a meaningful impact in the field of cybersecurity.
        
        Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects, skills, and experiences. Let’s connect and discuss how we can collaborate to build secure and resilient digital environments.
